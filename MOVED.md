# ATEMS has moved

**Canonical location:** `/home/n4s1/ATEMS` (standalone repo, not inside rankings-bot).

- To run ATEMS: open `/home/n4s1/ATEMS` in Cursor or use the desktop icon (if it points to the new path).
- This copy under `rankings-bot/ATEMS` is left for reference. You can delete this folder once you use the new location.

To use the new copy:
1. Open folder `/home/n4s1/ATEMS` in Cursor (File → Open Folder).
2. Copy your desktop shortcuts from `/home/n4s1/ATEMS/*.desktop` to your Desktop or `~/.local/share/applications/` if needed.
