# US Air Force Tool Accountability — Research Brief

**Purpose:** Support a possible contract pursuit with ATEMS. The Air Force used to use **ITAS** (or a similarly named system) for tool accountability; this brief summarizes what they use *now* and where ATEMS could fit.

---

## 1. Current policy and programs

### CTK (Consolidated Tool Kit)

- **Authority:** **AFI 21-101** (Aircraft and Equipment Maintenance Management). Many bases also have wing-level supplements (e.g. 452 AMWI 21-102, 920 RQWI 21-117).
- **Goal:** Positive control and accountability of tools, equipment, and electronic devices used on aircraft and in maintenance to prevent **FOD** (Foreign Object Debris/Damage).
- **Structure:** Unit commanders own the program; Flight Chiefs, Section NCOICs, and Chief Enlisted Managers run CTK; each section designates **primary and alternate tool control custodians** in writing.
- **Requirements:** Inventory control, lost-tool procedures, documented control systems; tools taken to the flight line must be tracked (including tech orders, checklists, electronic devices).
- **Scope:** Applies from small shops (e.g. Airfield Management) to large ones (e.g. Aircraft Maintenance with hundreds of tools). All must show positive tool and equipment accountability.

**Takeaway:** The Air Force *mandate* is CTK under AFI 21-101. The *software* used to run CTK is often base- or unit-specific; there is no single, service-wide “ITAS replacement” name in public sources.

### FLITES (item catalog — not tool crib software)

- **FLITES** = Foundational Logistics Information Technology Enterprise System.
- **Role:** Replaces **IMCS/D043** (Item Management Control System, 1970s) as the **item catalog** for the Department of the Air Force (parts, NIINs, description/reference data — “nuts and bolts to radars and aircraft”).
- **Timeline:** FLITES 1.0 (Sept 2024), FLITES 1.1.1 (April 2025); full replacement of IMCS by April 2026.
- **Not:** A tool crib check-in/check-out or calibration-due system. It’s logistics *catalog* and item management, not the same mission as ATEMS.

### Equipment inventory and reporting

- **DAFI 21-103** — Equipment Inventory, Status, and Utilization Reporting (mission-essential systems/equipment, weapon systems).
- **AFH 23-123 Vol 3** / **AFI 23-101** / **AFMAN 23-122** — Organizational equipment and materiel management.

These drive *reporting* and *policy*, not a single commercial tool-crib product name.

## 2. ITAS

- In public sources, **“ITAS”** in the Air Force context often refers to:
  - **Information Technology Approval System** (IT acquisition approval), or
  - **Integrated Time and Attendance System** (HR).
- A legacy **“Integrated Tool Accountability System”** (or similar) used specifically for tool crib accountability was **not** clearly identified in search results. It may have been:
  - A local or program-specific name,
  - An older system since replaced by base-level or commercial solutions, or
  - Referenced under a different acronym.

For a proposal, you can still say “the Air Force previously used ITAS (or a legacy tool accountability system) and now relies on CTK programs under AFI 21-101, with a need for modern tool crib and calibration tracking.”

## 3. Recent contracts and SBIRs (opportunity signals)

| Contract / program | Description | Relevance to ATEMS |
|-------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| **FA864923P0189** (Parcell, SBIR Phase I, ~$75K, ended Feb 2023) | “Smart Tool Control: Integrated CTK” — automate tool/item issuance for aircraft maintenance task orders; ML + integration with DAF maintenance systems. | Shows demand for **integrated tool control/CTK** and automation; ATEMS could position as check-in/out + calibration + reporting. |
| **FA5606-23-P-0063** (Paragon Robotics, SBIR Phase I, ~$179K, 2023–2024) | “Automatic tool kit tracking system retrofit for USAF tool centers” — retrofit legacy USAF mobile tool kits; modernize “dumb” toolkits; FOD assurance, manpower savings. | Direct **tool tracking / tool kit accountability** for USAF tool centers; ATEMS fits tool crib + tracking + calibration. |
| **N68335-23-C-0313** (Navy, Intellisense, Phase II, ~$1.3M) | Autonomous robotic calibration system (gauge blocks). | Shows DoD investment in **calibration automation**; ATEMS calibration-due and tracking align. |

**Takeaway:** The Air Force (and DoD) are buying **tool accountability**, **tool kit tracking**, and **calibration** capabilities. There is no single mandated “ITAS replacement” product; there is room for solutions that support CTK compliance (inventory, custody, calibration, reporting).

## 4. Where ATEMS fits (contract angle)

- **CTK compliance:** ATEMS already does tool crib check-in/out, custodians, categories, calibration due, and reports — all of which support AFI 21-101 CTK requirements (positive control, inventory, lost-tool procedures, documentation).
- **Calibration:** Calibration due/overdue and tracking match DoD/Air Force emphasis (e.g. SBIRs, ISO 17025-type expectations for calibration labs).
- **Positioning:** “Modern tool accountability and calibration management for Air Force CTK programs — replacing or augmenting legacy and manual processes (e.g. former ITAS or similar) with a single system for inventory, custody, calibration, and reporting.”

## 5. Suggested next steps

1. **SAM.gov / beta.SAM.gov** — Search “tool accountability,” “tool crib,” “CTK,” “calibration tracking,” “AFI 21-101” for recent and upcoming opportunities (Air Force, AFMC, AFRL, MAJCOMs).
2. **SBIR/STTR** — Monitor Air Force SBIR topics under maintenance, logistics, and calibration for Phase I/II that align with tool control and CTK.
3. **References** — Pull the actual AFI 21-101 and a wing supplement (e.g. 452 AMWI 21-102) to cite CTK requirements and map ATEMS features to them.
4. **Past performance** — If you have demo sites or pilots (e.g. “50K tools, calibration due, check-in/out”), frame them as scalable for Air Force tool centers and CTK programs.
